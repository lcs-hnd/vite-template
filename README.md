## Dependencies

- **prettier**: Enforces consistent code formatting.

- **eslint** + **@eslint/js**: Lints JavaScript for common mistakes and enforces best practices.

- **eslint-config-prettier**: Turns off ESLint rules that would conflict with Prettier.

- **stylelint** + **sylelint-config-standard**: CSS linting based on standard conventions, improving maintainability of styles.

- **stylelint-order**: Enforces logical property grouping and ordering for cleaner stylesheets.

- **concurrently**: Runs multiple linters in watch mode at once with clean, organized output.

## Config Files

**.eslint.config.mjs**

> Uses the flat ESLint config with @eslint/js as the base. Adds Prettier compatibility and a small set of project-agnostic quality rules (e.g., no-var, prefer-const).

**.stylelintrc.json**

> Extends stylelint-config-standard with custom property groups and ordering logic. Prioritizes CSS readability and visual hierarchy by grouping properties like layout, box model, and typography.

**.prettierrc**

> A concise Prettier setup enforcing single quotes, semi-colons, and a consistent print width (80) for balanced readability and diff clarity.

**.prettierignore**

> Excludes folders like dist, node_modules, and build artifacts from formatting to speed up Prettier runs and avoid unnecessary churn.
